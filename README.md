# SimpleCRUD with ngrx

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Retrieve Update and Delete) implementation using ngrx (Redux implementation for Angular using Observables).

It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Pre-requisites

The following tools have to be installed:

- node and npm: check `https://nodejs.org`
- angular-cli: `npm install -g @angular-cli`
- json-server: `npm install -g json-server`

## Back-end

json-server is used for the back-end. It's a full REST API server based on a json file (read and write). To start it up, use the following command:

`npm run backend`

## Front-end

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
